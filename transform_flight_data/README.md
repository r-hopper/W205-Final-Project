## Step 1

In Hive, run load_2007_2016.sql. This will load all of the files from 2007-2016 into Hive, separated by month.

## Step 2

Run months_to_years.sql. This will compile all of the separate monthly files by year.

## Step 3

Run all_years.sql. This will compile all of the years into one table.

## Step 4

Run one_to_five_years.sql, which will separate the full ten years into five-year blocks.
